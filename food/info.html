            What Is Food Storage Manager?
        </h2>
        <p>
            The Food Storage Manager is a tool for maintaining and monitoring inventory.  
            It was designed primarily with home food storage in mind, 
            but the ability to create categories and subcategories allows you the flexibility to manage much more.
        </p>
        <p>
            It is programmed in JavaScript, HTML, CSS, PHP, and MySQL, 
            and so it is designed to be served by an appropriate home server and used in a browser.  
            See the GitHub repository for more information on setup.
        </p>

        <h2>
            How it Works
        </h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Start by navigating to Add Values from the + icon on the navigation bar.  
            </li>
            <li>
                Create your first Category:
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        First, create the units that these items will be measured in.  
                        For example, if you&#39ll be tracking inventory of Flour, you may want to use &quotlb&quot is the unit of measure.  
                        Enter this (lb) in the &quotNew Unit&quot field, and submit by clicking &quotAdd&quot.  
                        You can see a current list of units by clicking on the &quotCurrent Units&quot dropdown above it.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Now, type a 3-letter category ID, and a long-form description below it.  
                        For example, for flour you might want your ID and description to be &quotFLO&quot and &quotFlour&quot, respectively.  
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Select the unit of measure for this category.  
                        This will be the unit associated with this category for any inventory items added later.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Submit the new category by clicking &quotAdd&quot.
                    </li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>
                Add an item to the inventory by navigating to Add Item, from the <img src="images/pluswhite.png" height="20" width="20"> icon.
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        All fields except for the Price must be filled in.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The Date Received is the date that you want to indicate it was brought into the inventory.  
                        It can be &#8208 but does not have to be &#8208 the current date.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Choose a Category from your categories list.  
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Input a Subcategory that describes the item in a bit more detail (eg. &quotWhole Wheat Flour&quot).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Input the Source from which the item was obtained (eg. &quotEarth Fare&quot or &quotHome Canning&quot).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Input the amount, in the category&#39s units, for each item obtained.  
                        For example, for 28 oz. cans of tomatoes, this value will be 28.  
                        The quantity of cans will be inputted next.  The units will automatically populate.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Now input the quantity of items being inputted.  If there were 12 cans of 28 oz., 
                        this value will be 12.  The total number of ounces will be calculated by taking the product 
                        of the Amount and Quantity fields before insertion into the database.  
                        Therefore, only items of equal Amounts should be inserted together.  
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Input the expiration date of the item(s) in MM/YYYY format.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Optionally, input the Price paid for all combined items (eg. all 12 cans).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Submit by clicking &quotAdd&quot.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        After successful submission, you will be shown the unique code which is generated 
                        by the database.  This is how this item will be tracked and referenced, 
                        and so it&#39s a good idea to label the items with this code.
                    </li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>
                Search for items in the database using the Search Item page from the <img src="images/searchwhite.png" height="20" width="20"> icon.  
                You can search by Code or Description.  Autocomplete will begin returning results 
                once at least 3 characters have been typed.  Select the desired record from the options 
                and click &quotSelect&quot to view.
            </li>
            <li>
                You can edit and update an item from the View Item page.  
                This page can be reached by clicking on a record from the Search Item page 
                or any other page where a blue Code is found.
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Edit a field which already has a value by clicking on that value then typing the new value. 
                        Some fields cannot be changed.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Input a new value for a field that does not yet have a value by clicking 
                        where that value should be on the table then typing the new value.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        After typing all desired inputs, click Update Item to save.
                    </li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>
                The <img src="images/viewwhite.png" height="20" width="20"> menu contains several pages for viewing the items and associated data.
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        The Current page displays all of the items which are currently in use, 
                        meaning that they have a Start Date but no End Date.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The Next page displays the next item for each Category and Subcategory, 
                        based on the Date Received (the item with the oldest Date Received will be displayed).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The Metrics page displays various metrics for the Categories and their Subcategories.
                        <ol>
                            <li>
                                Inventory is calculated by adding all of the items of that category 
                                or subcategory that do not have End Dates.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Average Rate is calculated by summing the total units consumed (items with End Dates) and 
                                dividing by the sum of the time it took to consume these units.  
                                It is converted to units/week for this metric.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                The Supply is calculated by dividing the Inventory by the Average Rate, as calculated above.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                The Surplus/Deficit is calculated by subtracting the current Inventory by 26 weeks 
                                (6 months) of supply.  In other words, this value shows how much surplus or deficit 
                                you have of this category where your target is 6 months of supply at your 
                                Average Rate of consumption.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                The Average Price Per Unit and Minimum Price Per Unit are calculated by Subcategory only.
                            </li>
                        </ol>

                    <li>
                        The Inventory page allows you to view all items in the database.  
                        You can filter by status (Stock: no Start Date set, In Use: Start Date set but no End Date set, 
                        or Done: End Date set) or by Category.
